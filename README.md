# üßê What is This?

This project is an interactive visualization of the **Mandelbrot set**, one of the most famous and beautiful fractals in mathematics.

A fractal is a never-ending pattern that is "self-similar"‚Äîmeaning it repeats itself at different scales. No matter how much you zoom in, you will find new, intricate patterns that look similar to the whole.

# The Simple Math Behind the Infinite Complexity

The entire image is generated by a single, simple algebraic function:

$$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

Here's what that means:

1.  **Map:** Every pixel on the canvas is mapped to a **complex number** ($c$).
2.  **Test:** The app runs this simple test on every single number, over and over.
3.  **Color:**
      * If the number stays "trapped" and never grows too big, it's colored **black** (it's *in* the set).
      * If the number "escapes" and flies to infinity, it's colored based on *how fast* it escaped. This creates the beautiful bands of color.

You are literally looking at a picture of infinity.
